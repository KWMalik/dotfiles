Installing Dependencies
=======================

You've got jtratner's dotfiles, but unfortunately that's not all that you need
to run them. You also need to install the appropriate dependencies.
Unfortunately, I can't cover every dependency, but I'll try to mark all the
high-level dependencies.

Places to search for information on dependencies
================================================

Sometimes developers don't realize all of the dependencies necessary to run
their files (generally because they have them all installed already from their
development). So, aside from this doc, the best place to find such info is
often on discussion forums.  I particularly recommend the following:


`Github/developers website`_                               Obviously you should check here first.
`Documentation`_                                           Try reading the documentation for more (sometimes you have to
                                                           look in the source code to actually find it.
`Stack Overflow`_                                          Great community, often has the answers right at your
                                                           fingertips (or very quickly available)
`Google`_                                                  Searching for error messages or "dependencies" can yield wonders.
