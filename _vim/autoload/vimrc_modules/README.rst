Making vimrc easier to edit
===========================

I was inspired to split up my vimrc and (soon) bashrc after reading Zach
Holman's great article on dotfiles `"Dotfiles Are Meant To Be Forked"`_. There's
no point in stuffing everything into one file, when you can split it up into
parts and be able to more easily read and edit your dotfiles. This directory
contains a list of my dotfiles (and eventually there will be a corresponding
helptag listing all the custom commands in the dotfiles).
